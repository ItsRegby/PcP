# Parallel and Distributed Programming Course

This repository contains code examples and implementations developed during the Parallel and Distributed Programming course. The course covers various concepts and technologies related to parallel and distributed programming, as well as their implementations across different programming languages.

## Contents

In this repository, you'll find code samples developed during the laboratory works, covering the following topics:

1. **Laboratory Work 1**: Means of Creating Multi-threaded Programs
   - Implementations of processing numerical sequences in different threads using Java and Ada

2. **Laboratory Work 2**: Thread Synchronization Mechanisms
   - Java and Ada programs for finding the minimum element in an array using parallel threads and synchronization mechanisms

3. **Laboratory Work 3**: Advanced Thread Synchronization Mechanisms (Semaphores)
   - Examples of using semaphores for thread synchronization in producer-consumer problems in Java and Ada

4. **Laboratory Work 4**: Thread Deadlock (Dining Philosophers Problem)
   - Implementations of the Dining Philosophers problem with different strategies for resolving deadlock using Java and Ada

5. **Laboratory Work 5**: OpenMP Technology
   - Examples of using OpenMP directives for parallelizing sequential programs and modeling the Dining Philosophers situation

## Usage

For each laboratory work, you'll find source code files for Java, Ada, and, in some cases, C++. These files can be compiled and run in their respective development environments or via the command line.

Additionally, each folder contains a detailed description of the laboratory work, its objectives, execution steps, and results.

## Requirements

To compile and run the code examples across different programming languages, you'll need to have the appropriate development environment or compilers installed:

- Java: Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Ada: GNAT (GNU Ada Compiler)
- C++ (for OpenMP): A compiler supporting OpenMP (e.g., GCC)

## Contribution

This repository is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate code examples, so external contributions are not accepted. However, you are welcome to use these codes for your own learning and experimentation.

## Author

This repository was created by Eduard Shevchenko as part of the Parallel and Distributed Programming course at The Bohdan Khmelnytsky National University of Cherkasy.
